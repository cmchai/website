## The aim of this research project
We aim to explore whether people can dynamically control the strength of task information during task preparation when they expect to potentially switch to another task.

## Main research tools and techniques

**Behavioral experimentation**: 
For the purpose of this study, we have designed a behavioral paradigm in which participants were encouraged to dynamically modulate their task preparation process when they are not certain of the task that they are going to perform. \(for more information regarding the paradigm itself, please see our [published article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027724000702)\).

**Behavioral modeling**:
To further elucidate the cognitive process underlying the behavioral findings, we have built a model \(drift difussion model\) to examine the evidence accumulation process when people were performing on this task. Various parameters from this model can be informative in 

## Key findings
We found that, when people are not certain about the task that they are going to perform, they can adaptively modulate the strength of that task. Namely, when they are certain that they will perform on a task, the strength of that task can be enhanced. In comparison, when they predict that they would probably switch to another unknown task, they can adaptively down-regualate the strength of the irrelevant task. We also observed that, when they were not certain about the task that they are going to perform, they are more influencd by the irrelevant task information during task implementation.
