## The aim of this research project
To furhter deepen our understanding on the neural dynamics when we face task uncertainty, we conduct this EEG + Eye tracking study, in which we measure the statistical regularity of the EEG signal, as well as the pupil dilation.

## Main research tools and techniques

**EEG \(electroencephalogram\)**: 
We record 64-channel EEG \(10-20 system\) data while participants were performing on a task in a uncertain environment. To manage this uncertainty, they have to dynamically regulate their task preparation process, which can impact the variability\(or the statistical regularity\) of the EEG signal.

**Eye Tracking**: 
In addtion, we also collected eye tracking data during task performance. We are mostly interested in the dynamics of their pupil dilation as a index of their overall level of task engagement. We predict that people can adaptively regulate their task engagement based on how uncertain the task is.

**Complexity Analysis on Biological Signal Time Series**
To quantify the statistical regularity of the EEG signal, we adopted measures from information theory, such as sample entropy, or multi-scale entropy. These measures can be seen as a indicator of how much excitable the brain is. We predict that higher task uncertainty would result in higher excitability of the brain, which would be reflected in high entropy in the EEG signal.

## Key findings
Stay tuned...
