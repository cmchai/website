## The aim of this research project
Computer assistance has become more and more prevalent and deeply integrated in our everyday life. For instance, we have are already used to seeking help from siri to do some operation on our smart phones. Smart homes,in which we can monitor and control all the appliance and system in our houses via internet connection is also a prime example of this trend. Thus, it has become an active research field to optimize this assistance so that we can get better help from it. 

This is particularly important in some working scenarios that require high level of cognitive demand, such as air traffic control. In this project, we aim to optimize the computer assistance in a traffic control game. Specifically, we want to collect several types of physological data from a wearble device and build a model to predict people's stress level so that the level of computer assistance can be adaptively adjusted. 

## Main research tools and techniques

**Unity gaming interface**: 
we have created a traffic control game, in which participants have to control several intersections on a street where cars continuously drive through. Participants have to manually rotate those intersections to let cars pass to prevent any crash. In the meantime, participants can also adjust the level of computer assistance that they need so that a certain proportion of the intersections can be handed over to the computer to control when participants feel overwelmed.

**Empatica wristband**: 
We are using the research-level wearable device from [Empatica EmbracePlus](https://www.empatica.com/embraceplus/) to collect real-time time series of several key physiological indicators that can be used to predict people's cognitive load and stress level, such as heart rate, heart rate variability, skin conductance, and skin temporature.

**Signal processing and Machine learning techniques**
These physiological data are further analyzed using techniques from signal processing, especially regarding time series analysis, as well as several machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model on people's intention to up- or down regualate the level of the assistance. Once we can build a model that can generate accurate and robust predictions, this model can be used to automatically adjust the level of computer assistance.
